      In the age of technology and social media, most companies are turning to
      e-marketing, as it is easier and more economical. To expand their reach,
      many local companies and businesses rely on their social media accounts
      for marketing and communicating with customers. Although we all use social
      media, using it in a brand marketing can be a difficult challenge,
      especially when activating more than one platform. And this is because of
      the difficulty of following up on all platforms and solving their
      problems.

      As more businesses rely on social media for marketing and consumer
      involvement, managing various platforms has become a difficult and
      time-consuming effort. Local businesses, especially small ones, struggle
      to properly monitor and manage their performance in multiple channels.

      Managing each platform individually does not provide an analysis of the
      business performance, customer reach, and satisfaction. This frequently
      leads to inefficient administration, different marketing purposes in each
      platform, and missed opportunities to engage with potential customers.
